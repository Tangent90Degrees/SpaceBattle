# Space Battle: The Alien Alliance

Game Description and Instructions

This is a two-player cooperative game where you and another online player fight against aliens to get the 
highest score possible within a limited time. In the game, you can score points by shooting aliens, and at 
the same time, you must also pay attention to dodge the aliens' bullets. As time goes by, the aliens will 
become more powerful and the more points you can earn. However, you can probably die much easier and, don't 
worry, there will be randomly generated power-ups to help you during the game.
